Welcome to the repository! 

Please familiarize yourself with Github, we will use it to share code for WP4.

The python packages that we are going to use:  
matplotlib  
numpy  
scipy

File structure and naming convention:

Name your files in lowercase  
Try to organize it in categories going from top level category downwards, for example:  
fast_forces  
This designates a file in category fasteners calculating forces.  
Do not call your files based on the deliverable number or anything else. Make sure one can understand what your code is about just from seeing the title.
