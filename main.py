This is the ultimate file. The file that runs iterations on every possible
combination of the lug design. It considers:
o lug dimensions,
o back-up wall bearing checks,
o back-up wall bearing checks including thermal loads
o back-up wall pull-through checks,
o vehicle wall bearing checks including thermal loads
o vehicle wall pull-through checks.  RIGHT?
